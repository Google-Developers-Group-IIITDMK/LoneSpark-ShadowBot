# ShadowBot
UmbrAI (ShadowCore) is a voice-enabled personal assistant built with Python, Tkinter, and AI-powered libraries. It can recognize spoken or typed commands, respond with natural speech, fetch information from the web (like Wikipedia), tell jokes, and open websites — all inside an interactive GUI.

Inspired by Solo Leveling’s “System”, UmbrAI acts like your personal shadow companion, always ready to assist with commands. Whether it’s checking the time, cracking a joke, or pulling knowledge from the depths of the internet, the assistant responds instantly — like a loyal shadow soldier.

Key Features:

🎙 Voice Commands (speech recognition with Google API)

💬 Text-to-Speech (pyttsx3) for natural responses

🌐 Web Integration (YouTube, Google, Wikipedia search)

😂 Entertainment (pyjokes)

🖥 User-Friendly GUI (Tkinter with chat-style interface)

⚡ Fallback Typing Support if mic isn’t available

This project merges the fun of anime-inspired design with practical coding, making everyday tasks feel like leveling up with your own AI shadow companion.
